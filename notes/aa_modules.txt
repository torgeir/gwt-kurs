A GWT module includes
	An xml file
		src/gwtWorkshop/mod1/Mod1.gwt.xml
	
	at least one client side source folder
		this have to be siblings to the gwt.xml file
		By default, this folder is called client
			But, with an entry in the gwt.xml file you can rename it or have multiple
		This is where you put .java files that you want compiled to javascript
		
	Optionally, one of the classes in the client folder(s) can have an EntryPoint
	
	Example
		src/gwtWorkshop/mod1/Mod1.gwt.xml
		src/gwtWorkshop/mod1/client/
			Foo.java
			Boo.java
		
	Where
		The module name is
			gwtWorkshop.mod1.Mod1
			
			The module name is used
				by the command line tools (DevMode, Compiler)
				in the gwt.xml file itself when inheriting other modules
				the default gwt compiler output folder
